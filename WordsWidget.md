# Words widget

Create a widget that allows a user to enter a sentence of 5 or more words. When the user clicks a button the sentence should be analyzed.

The widget: 

* should **highlight** any word that is **longer than 4 characters**,
* and show **how many words** are in the sentence.

Select a decent color sceme for your widget from [coolors](https://coolors.co/).
